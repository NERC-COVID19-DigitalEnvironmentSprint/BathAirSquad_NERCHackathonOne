NO2:

- from:vehicle emissions,gas stoves,power plants, fossil fuel burning process
- EPA anual mean limit: 0.053ppm (100 ug/m3)
- controlled exposure to NO2 can elicit an inflammatory response in healthy subjects and
can enhance the response to inhaled allergen in asthmatic subjects
- mostly affects children. 
- experimental studies: it increases susceptibility to influenza virus infections.
	exposure to NO2 can adversely affect the development of virus-specific immunity
	NO2-exposed mice were reinfected more that air-exposed mice 
	usual dosis for experiments: 5ppm(6h/day) other 2ppm(3h/day)

O3: 

- from: formed by NOx + VOCs, also vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and chemical solvents, 
	natural sources
- EPA: 1h standard of 0.12ppm and 8h standard of 0.08ppm (1h standard revoked in 2015)
- oxidative activity elicit inflammatory response in the lungs.
- mostly affects old people (>65yr)
- influenza: short-term in mice showed 1ppm exposure (3h/day) had effects after 1 day and 0.5ppm had no
	   effects but change in lungs was more severe on exposed mice. 
	    other study on mice-adapted strain of influenza showed that 0.5ppm exposure reduced the severity
	   of the disease. Other infected mice and then exposed them w/ 0.5ppm with no effects
	   but after 30days could see change in lungs (posibly because of oxidative activity of O3)
- other virus: mixed results, some saw effects on inflammatory response, others no effect (posibly because it
		depends on many  variables and O3 may have virucidal action that would reduce infectivity if subject
		is exposed during infection)

PM: 
- mixture of particles and droplets in the air, consisting of a variety of components such as organic compounds, 
	metals, acids, soil, and dust
- coarse (aerodynamic diameter 2.5–10 µm), fine (<2.5 µm), and ultrafine (<0.1 µm).
- from: coarse mainly from the abrasion of soil, brake, and tire materials, or the aggregation of smaller particles
	fine and ultrafine particles are generated predominantly by the combustion of fossil fuels (especially from motor vehicles).
- Smaller particles tend to be more of a health concern since they are easily respirable, can deposit deeper in the lungs than larger particles
- majority of studies examining the health effects of exposure to ambient PM focus on the incidence of mortality and hospital admissions.
- In a study examining the effects of PM2.5 levels in 23 different cities, it was estimated that approximately 17,000 premature deaths could be prevented
	annually if long-term exposure to PM2.5 levels were reduced by 15 µg/m3 in each of the cities included in the study
- rates of chronic cough, bronchitis, and chest illness were positively associated with levels of PM.
- increased risk of mortality from pneumonia and influenza associated with a 10-µg/m3 increase in the levels of PM over the course of a few years.
- short-term : 60-µg/m3  increase in PM resulted in a 27% increase in croup cases for children. 10-µg/m3 increase in same-day levels of PM resulted 
	in increased hospital admissions for respiratory infections
- experiments in mice: exposure to either concentrated ambient PM or ultrafine carbon black particles can significantly affect respiratory virus-induced 
	inflammation and morbidity, which may at least partially be caused by the decreased ability of macrophages to phagocytize the virus and mount an effective 
	immune response against the infection.

Diesel exhaust:
- DE contains both particulate phase as well as gas-phase components such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxides, hydrocarbons, transition metals, and formaldehyde
- short-term exposure in mice showed that DE-exposed mice were more susceptible to RSV (syncytial virus)
- exposure to low  dose of DE of human respiratory epithelial to DE enhances the susceptibility to influenza infections
- studies demonstrate that exposure to DE can enhance the susceptibility and response to respiratory viral infections, and may result in an enhancement
	of the resulting morbidity of infection.

indoor pollutants:
- environmental tobacco smoke (ETS): studies mainly focused on children, associated to increased prevalence and severity of respiratory infections	
-  parental smoking was associated with 22,000 hospitalizations and 1100 deaths involving children with RSV bronchiolitis
- Studies in adults have shown that women exposed to ETS had a slightly increased risk of both more frequent colds and more prolonged colds
- mechanism is unknown
- Biomass fuels: wood, dung, charcoal, or agricultural residues, mainly used in less developed countries. Associated to development of acute respiratory
infections in both adults and children. epidemiological evidence showing an association between exposure to biomass combustion and deaths caused by 
respiratory infections in children
