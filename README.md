# BathAirSquad_NERCHackathonOne

This folder contains several files related to the Hackathon One - Air Quality. 

Hackathon - is the main folder containing all the data, R files to run the proposed INLA Bayesian Model. It also contains the report of the work done by the group and corresponding video. 

	Folders: 
		raw_data - data as downloaded from the resources as
				described in the report.
		processed_data - cleaned data ready to use as input for
				 the model 
		INLA_results - contains folders automatically generated
				 by the model with the results for each type 
				 of model as explained in the report. 

	
	Files:
	BathAirSquad_summary_presentation - report of the work done, 
		with description of the proposed model and its
		implementation.
	INLA_Bayesian_Framework - main R file. Model proposed for 
		this challenge. Details are described in the summary.
	INLA_data_preprocessing - file for cleaning the raw data and 
		create the data frames used in
		INLA_Bayesian_Framework.R
 	Pollutant_data_preprocessing - file for cleaning the raw 
		pollutant data 


Italy_Bayesian_Framework 	- contains data for Italy and the
					corresponding R files to run the INLA 
					Bayesian model as in the folder
					Hackathon.
