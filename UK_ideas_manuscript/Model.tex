Quantification of COVID-19:
\begin{itemize}
\item In line with the problem outline our response variables should be "respiratory stress, a more effective distribution mechanism (what is this?) and greater virus longevity".
\item Incidence could be quantified as the R number, given the air quality level.
\end{itemize}

Piotr is thinking about a model for the new cases.
